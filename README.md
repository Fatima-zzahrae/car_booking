#### Description: 
It is a website built using PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and MySQL.

It lets the user register as a passenger or driver. After signing up and logging in, the passenger enters the origin and destination, the road appears on the map and the distance and the cost are calculated. 

Once the passenger requests the ride, it appears on the driver's dashboard. The status of the ride changes on the passenger side when the driver accepts the ride, arrives at his location, picks him up, and drops him off.

After that, the driver's dashboard becomes empty until a new ride is requested, and past rides remain recorded in the ride history of the passenger.
